# Merge Sort & Quick Sort
```
This lab contains the files for class 23 and 24 (cross listed as 24 and 25 in CSC207
website). We made Mergesort and Quicksort algorithms where we explored how we can
implement quicksort without making any copy of arrays, and mergesort becomes expensive
due to such methods (not expensive when not generic).
